# Number-Guessing-Game
The Number Guessing Game is a simple Python-based project where the player has to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts.

## How to Play
1. The game will generate a random number between 0 and 100.
2. You will have **7 attempts** to guess the number.
3. After each guess, you will be told whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. If you guess the number correctly, you win! ðŸŽ‰
5. If you fail to guess the number within 7 attempts, the correct number will be revealed.
